# Highway-Car-Counting

This project implements a vehicle tracking and counting system using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The script processes a video, tracks vehicles, and counts the number of vehicles moving in two directions across a reference line.

## Features
- Tracks and counts vehicles such as cars, trucks, and buses.
- Visualizes vehicle paths with unique IDs and bounding boxes.
- Displays a reference line to differentiate between incoming and outgoing vehicles.
- Outputs a processed video with the tracking information.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Imutils
- Ultralytics YOLO
